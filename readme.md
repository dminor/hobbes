Sora
====

Sora is a little language written as a exercise to learn more about type
checking and type inference. My first language
[Scoundrel](https://github.com/dminor/scoundrel) is a purely functional
subset of Lua, written to learn more about Rust and interpreters in general.
My second language [Walden](https://github.com/dminor/walden) is a
Smalltalk/Self dialect, and was written to learn about object-oriented
languages and how virtual machines work. My plan for Sora is to make
something similar to Scoundrel, but with static typing and type inference.
Depending upon how things go, I'd also like to try hooking up an existing
library for JIT support (e.g.
[Cranelift](https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift)).

The language is named after the sora, a shy but widespread bird of marshes
and wetlands in the Americas.
